# DreamTeam CRM

### Summary

DreamTeam\
Personal CRM for IT Capstone Project

This is a customer relationships manager web application designed to help users manage their relationships with customers, clients, colleagues, etc. 

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Make sure you are in the backend directory. 
```bash
cd backend

npm run dev
```

To run the frontend, move to the front end directory and run `npm start`
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
```bash
cd frontend

npm start
```

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

You may need to run `npm install` before running the app - see below. 

### `npm install`

You may need to run this command in the backend, frontend and root directories in order to install dependencies. 
```bash
# root
npm install

# frontend
cd frontend
npm install

# backend
cd backend
npm install
```

### `npm start`

Runs the app locally.\
Need to run the backend and frontend folder separately with the script
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm test`

Please cd into the backend folder before running the script.
```bash
cd backend

npm test
```

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
```bash
npm run build
```
The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
